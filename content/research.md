I obtained a PhD (2009 - 2011) in Artificial Intelligence &amp; Computational Linguistics from the Middlesex University, London, under [Dr. Christian Huyck](http://www.cwa.mdx.ac.uk/chris/).

My thesis—&ldquo;*Modelling Emergent Phenomena in Associative Memory with Neural Cell Assemblies*&rdquo;—dealt ([PDF](files/kailash-phd-thesis.pdf)) with the dynamics of associative memories modeled in in neural Cell Assemblies. The work involved creating Hebbian Cell Assembly models investigating natural language processing, simulated vision, spatial cognitive mapping, queriable hierarchical memories, self-learning agents, and more.

~~I currently hold a research fellowship at the Middlesex university, and continue to pursue research independently and very sporadically.~~ I, unfortunately, at this point (2019), have not pursued any form of research in a long time.
