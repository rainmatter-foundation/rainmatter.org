            Crossing seven of nine planetary boundaries is a stark reminder that we must act now, not later. It calls for building a resilient economy, and it cannot be done in silos.<br/><br/>
            This forms the basis of the report on "The State of Climate Response in India", a collaborative initiative by Deloitte India and the Rainmatter Foundation, which was launched on 30th October 2025.<br/><br/>
            The report consolidates:
            <ul>
                <li>Climate indicators to enable data-driven strategies, aligning growth and environmental stability.</li>
                <li>Interconnected risks that highlight the deeply systemic nature of climate stressors, with ripple effects across sectors.</li>
                <li>A nationwide survey of 1,700 households that examines how people understand and experience climate change.</li>
                <li>A corporate climate readiness survey which engaged more than 50 leading corporations across sectors.</li>
                <li>Case studies that show climate leadership can coexist with profitability.</li>
                <li>And a framework for action turning risk into resilience that calls for a whole-of-economy approach.</li>
            </ul>
            The study shows that by embracing interconnected complexity and coming out of silos, businesses and governments can unlock new opportunities for resilience and innovation. Rapid urbanisation, shifting rainfall, and rising temperatures pose real threats to food systems, water security, and power supply. But these same challenges present an opportunity to embed resilience into the country’s growth story. Actions must permeate every decision, from sourcing and materials to product lifecycles and efficiency.<br/><br/>
            Those who lead this shift will not just adapt, they will define the future.<br/><br/>
