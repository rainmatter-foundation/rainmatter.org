We also aim to work closely with local stakeholders to empower them and make them part of the whole rejuvenation.

Rainmatter and WASSAN have agreed to catalyze and co-create a scalable and sustainable ecosystem of support services in the most naturally rich but economically disadvantaged regions of India. The program will develop a framework to identify such regions with potential, map the actors and their networks, understand the issues through conversations and build upon the local successes to bring multiple actors together to evolve an ecosystem of support services for natural farming transitions.
