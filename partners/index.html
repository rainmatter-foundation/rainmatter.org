<p>Both re-wilding as well as the creation of a green economy need a deep understanding of ground realities and committed local changemakers to engage with local stakeholders. We forge partnerships and provide direct funding and support to organisations working at different areas of an entire spectrum.
If you are an organisation working in this space and would like to partner with us, please write to us at <a href="mailto:info@rainmatter.org">info@rainmatter.org</a>.</p>

            <p class="text-small">Preserving old-growth and native trees is one of the best ways to build-in environment resilience. Can private land-owners and farmers be persuaded not to chop trees on their lands for money or for firewood, and instead nurture them if they were paid to do so? Farmers For Forests is pioneering the payments-for-ecosystem-services concept in India, and the Foundation&#x27;s support is enabling them to try this with land-owners in Gadchiroli and Ratnagiri in Maharashtra.</p>
