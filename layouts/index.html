				<p>
					Founded in 2019, we are a non-profit organisation in India that supports organisations and projects
					for climate action, a healthier environment, and livelihoods associated with them.
				</p>
				<p>
					We strive to be a common platform for various stakeholders (CSOs, NGOs, startups, policy makers et. al.)
					working in the climate space to collaborate on meaningful and impactful work on serious issues
					pertaining to climate and environment in the areas of forests, water, soil, farm, food systems,
					ecology, energy, and transport.
				</p>
				<p>
					To enable and accelerate such an ecosystem, we have committed $200 million in funding and grants to individuals
					and organisations working in these areas.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are focused on fostering and assisting ideas that help preserve and regenerate ecosystems.
					Our belief is that this needs both direct grassroots interventions as well as the enablement of larger efforts
					that create a public mainstream understanding of the problems at hand, inviting broader participation,
					beyond the philanthropic efforts of a few.
				</p>
				<p>
					Indeed, we do not see this as charity, but as an investment into our own future and wellbeing.
				</p>

						<h3>Ecology</h3>
						<p>Water, air, soil, biodiversity. The foundational needs that are assumed to be free, but noticed only during collapse.</p>
					</li>
					<li style="border-color: #e9c6af">
						<h3>Human services</h3>
						<p>Education, healthcare, legal access, law and justice, common spaces, communication, representation, local access, and quality of life.
							Meaningful climate action needs to incorporate human needs.</p>

					<li style="border-color: #afdde9">
						<h3>Economy</h3>
						<p>Entrepreneurship, livelihoods, value addition, local capacities, production, and consumption. Reduce outside dependency and prevent leakage from local clusters.
							Environmental degradation is tightly coupled with economy and this has to be untangled carefully.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li style="border-color: #ffdd55">
						<h3>Pride and identity</h3>
						<p>Local culture, arts, crafts, GI, shared natural and cultural wealth and cuisines, tourism.
							Link environmental restoration and preservation to things that inspire identity and pride in people.</p>

		<h2>Our guiding principles</h2>

		<ul class="noul spaced">
			<li><strong>Mainstreaming</strong><br />We are looking at ideas that can be adapted, scaled and mainstreamed across landscapes; that place the power back to the people of the place; that encourage enabling responses over forcing interventions. </li>
			<li><strong>Collaboration/partnerships</strong><br />Common consensus, amplified  impact and ecosystem level infrastructure need solid, functional coalitions and openness in sharing. </li>
			<li><strong>Unexplored paths</strong><br />We realise climate change to be a complex and multi-faceted problem to address. It would require creative problem-solving and exploring previously uncharted directions. </li>
			<li><strong>Coordinated change with policy & governance</strong><br />We want to support alliances, participate in coalitions and actively push for systemic changes for larger impact.</li>
			<li><strong>Diversity of approaches</strong><br />Like any well-functioning ecosystem, competing as well as complementary ideas need to exist and we will support and work with ideas that might even seem at odds with each other.</li>
