and its subsequent growth over the next decade to being an industry leader. This growth
is rooted in strong first principles approach and deep philosophical convictions including
never advertising, to grow slowly and organically being bootstrapped, and to only ever
focus on quality for customers.</p><h3 id=2013>2013</h3><p>In 2013, when <a href=https://nadh.in>Kailash</a> comes onboard Zerodha starting its technology initiative,
one of the first things he does is to setup proper seggregation of waste in the office and educate people about it.
This is the seed that eventually germinates into the Rainmatter Foundation. Over the next many years,
a climate angst and grief ridden Kailash has endless conversations with <a href=https://nithinkamath.me>Nithin</a> about its perils.
Along the way, many business practices and decisions at Zerodha are based on the principles of minimalism and frugality,
including an early push to eliminate the use of paper in what was a heavily paper dependent industry.</p><h3 id=2015>2015</h3><p>By 2015, they are actively meeting people to understand how to support initiatives beyond the business
to grow the industry ecosystem with the philosophy that for any organisation to thrive, there has to
be a healthy, thriving ecosystem around it as well. This initiative becomes Rainmatter Capital, a fintech fund.</p><h3 id=2018>2018</h3><p>By 2018, as Zerodha grows more successful, it starts supporting a few environmental projects.
In the meanwhile, a large number of alarm bells starts ringing all across the world and the dangers of
climate change and environmental destruction start becoming apparent. This deepens the conviction
that without a healthy planet, there would not be much else to do meaningfully.</p><h3 id=2019>2019</h3><p>Nithin and Kailash start meeting people working in the environmental and conservation space,
actively looking for someone to lead a serious effort to take over the part time ad-hoc work they
had been doing. That these efforts must be structured as a non-profit organisation becomes clear.</p><h3 id=2020>2020</h3><p>While the foundation is being setup, they happen to meet <a href=https://zenx.medium.com/>Sameer</a>,
who had left behind his career in technology and moved to Coorg to experiment with sustainable farming,
farm collectives, and rejuvenation of soil and forests. Despite being an ardent skeptic of industry in general,
Sameer&rsquo;s philosophies align with the vision for Rainmatter Foundation, and he comes
on board full time to lead it. This also gives him a platform to scale up the experiments that
he had been trying in this space.</p><p>With Sameer on board and a commitment of $100 million from Zerodha to be invested in
projects that address environmental and climate problems, Rainmatter Foundation officially kick starts.</p><h3 id=2022>2022</h3><p>Under Sameer&rsquo;s leadership, the foundation grows into an independent team focused not just on managing
grants and funding organisations (where the endowment grows to $200 million),
but building a broad platform that dives deep and strategically connects projects and organisations
working in the space towards a common goal.</p></div></section></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="four columns"><div class=logo><a href=/><img src=/static/images/logo-mark.svg alt></a></div><p>Rainmatter Foundation &copy; 2019-2025<br><a href=mailto:info@rainmatter.org>info@rainmatter.org</a></p><p><strong>CIN</strong> U72900KA2016NPL093525</p></div><div class="four columns"><ul class=flat><li><a href=/><strong>Home</strong></a></li><li><a href=/about>About</a></li><li><a href=/partners>Partners</a></li><li><a href=/thesis>Thesis</a></li><li><a href=/disclosure>Disclosure</a></li><li><a href=https://grove.rainmatter.org>Forum</a></li><li><a href=https://listmonk.rainmatter.org/subscription/form>Newsletter</a></li></ul></div><div class="four columns"><strong>Address</strong><br>#47/1, 39th Cross Rd,<br>8th Block, Jayanagar,<br>Bengaluru - 560070</div></div></div></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/static/main.js></script></body></html>
